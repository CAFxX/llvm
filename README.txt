Welcome to LLVM!

This file provides the location of all important LLVM documentation.  In
particular, you should read the license information and the installation
directions before you begin using LLVM.

After that, there are several technical references that will help you use LLVM.
Consult them as necessary.

Finally, you can find information on how to communicate with the LLVM
developers and LLVM community.  This is of primary interest if you wish to
submit a bug, supply a patch, or just keep current with what's going on with
LLVM.
