Currently unimplemented:
* cast fp to bool
* signed right shift of long by reg

Current bugs:
* conditional branches assume target is within 32k bytes
* large fixed-size allocas not correct, although should
  be closer to working.  Added code in PPCRegisterInfo.cpp
  to do >16bit subtractions to the stack pointer.

Codegen improvements needed:
* no alias analysis causes us to generate slow code for Shootout/matrix
* setCondInst needs to know branchless versions of seteq/setne/etc
* cast elimination pass (uint -> sbyte -> short, kill the byte -> short)

Current hacks:
* lazy insert of GlobalBaseReg definition at front of first MBB
  A prime candidate for sabre's "slightly above ISel" passes.
* cast code is huge, unwieldy.  Should probably be broken up into
  smaller pieces.
* visitLoadInst is getting awfully cluttered as well.

Currently failing tests:
* Regression
* SingleSource
