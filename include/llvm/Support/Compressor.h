  /// a standard compression utility such as bzip2 or libz. This interface
  /// allos us to abstraction the notion of compression and deal with alternate
  /// compression scheme availability depending on the configured platform. This
  /// facility will always favor a bzip2 implementation if its available.
  /// Otherwise, libz will be used if its available. If neither zlib nor bzip2
  /// are available, a very simple algorithm provided by the Compressor class
  /// will be used The type of compression used can be determined by inspecting 
  /// the first byte of the compressed output. ASCII values '0', '1', and '2', 
  /// denote the compression type as given in the Algorithm enumeration below.
  /// The Compressor is intended for use with memory mapped files where the 
  /// entire data block to be compressed or decompressed is available in 
  /// memory. Output, however, can be gathered in repeated calls to a callback.
