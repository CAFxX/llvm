//===- llvm/Analysis/SafePointerAccess.h - Check pointer safety ---*- C++ -*-=//
//
// This file defines a pass that can be used to determine, interprocedurally, 
// which pointer types are accessed unsafely in a program.  If there is an
// "unsafe" access to a specific pointer type, transformations that depend on
// type safety cannot be permitted.
//
// The result of running this analysis over a program is a set of unsafe pointer
// types that cannot be transformed.  Safe pointer types are not tracked.
//
// Additionally, this analysis exports a hidden command line argument that (when
// enabled) prints out the reasons a type was determined to be unsafe.  Just add
// -unsafeptrinst to the command line of the tool you want to get it.
//
