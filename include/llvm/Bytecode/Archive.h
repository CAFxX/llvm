// This header file defines the interface to LLVM Archive files. The interface
// is provided by the Archive class implemented by the lib/Bytecode/Archive
// library.  This library is used to read and write archive (*.a) files that 
// contain LLVM bytecode files (or others). It provides rudimentary capabilities 
// to construct an archive file from a set of files, read the archive members 
// into memory, search the archive for member files that fulfill unresolved 
// symbols, and extract the archive back to the file system.  Full 
// symbol table support is provided for loading only those files that resolve 
// symbols. Note that read performance of this library is _crucial_ for 
// performance of JIT type applications and the linkers. Consequently, the 
// library is optimized for reading.
