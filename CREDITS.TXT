Inspired by the CREDITS file from the Linux source tree, this file is,
likewise, at least a partial list of people who have contributed to the LLVM
project. The format and the next paragraph are stolen directly from that file.

The list sorted by name and formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification
by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), PGP key ID
and fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address (S).
