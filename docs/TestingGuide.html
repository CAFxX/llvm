<p>The tests are located in two separate CVS modules. The basic feature and 
regression tests are in the main "llvm" module under the directory 
<tt>llvm/test</tt>. A more comprehensive test suite that includes whole 
programs in C and C++ is in the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module. This module should 
be checked out to the <tt>llvm/projects</tt> directory. When you
<tt>configure</tt> the <tt>llvm</tt> module, the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module
will be automatically configured. Or you can do it manually.</p>
<p>To run all of the simple tests in LLVM, use the master Makefile in the
<tt>llvm/test</tt> directory:</p>
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test
</pre>

<p>To run only the code fragment tests (i.e. those that do basic testing of
LLVM), run the tests organized by QMTest:</p>
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test qmtest
</pre>

<p>To run only the basic feature tests, QMTest supports the following
target:</p>
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test Feature.t
</pre>

<p>To run only the regression tests, QMTest supports the following
target:</p>
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test Regression.t
</pre>

<p>To run the comprehensive test suite (tests that compile and execute whole 
programs), run the <tt>llvm-test</tt> tests:</p>

<pre>
% cd llvm/projects
% cvs co llvm-test
% cd llvm-test
% ./configure --with-llvmsrc=$LLVM_SRC_ROOT --with-llvmobj=$LLVM_OBJ_ROOT
% gmake
</pre>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM test suite contains two major categories of tests: code
fragments and whole programs. Code fragments are in the <tt>llvm</tt> module
under the directory under the <tt>llvm/test</tt> directory. The whole programs
test suite are n the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module under the main directory.</p>

</div>

<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="codefragments">Code Fragments</a> 
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Code fragments are small pieces of code that test a specific feature of LLVM
or trigger a specific bug in LLVM.  They are usually written in LLVM assembly
language, but can be written in other languages if the test targets a particular
language front end.</p>

<p>Code fragments are not complete programs, and they are never executed to
determine correct behavior.</p> 

<p>Thes code fragment tests are located in the <tt>llvm/test/Features</tt> and 
<tt>llvm/test/Regression</tt> directories.</p>

</div>

<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="wholeprograms">Whole Programs</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Whole Programs are pieces of code which can be compiled and linked into a
stand-alone program that can be executed.  These programs are generally written
in high level languages such as C or C++, but sometimes they are written
straight in LLVM assembly.</p>

<p>These programs are compiled and then executed using several different
methods (native compiler, LLVM C backend, LLVM JIT, LLVM native code generation,
etc).  The output of these programs is compared to ensure that LLVM is compiling
the program correctly.</p>

<p>In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests serve as
a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the efficiency of the
programs generated as well as the speed with which LLVM compiles, optimizes, and
generates code.</p>

<p>All "whole program" tests are located in the <tt>llvm-test</tt> CVS
module.</p> 

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="tree">LLVM Test Suite Tree</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Each type of test in the LLVM test suite has its own directory. The major
subtrees of the test suite directory tree are as follows:</p>
    
<ul>
<li><tt>llvm/test/Features</tt>
<p>This directory contains sample codes that test various features of the
LLVM language.  These pieces of sample code are run through various
assembler, disassembler, and optimizer passes.</p>
</li>

<li><tt>llvm/test/Regression</tt>
<p>This directory contains regression tests for LLVM.  When a bug is found
in LLVM, a regression test containing just enough code to reproduce the
problem should be written and placed somewhere underneath this directory.
In most cases, this will be a small piece of LLVM assembly language code,
often distilled from an actual application or benchmark.</p>
</li>

<li><tt>llvm-test</tt>
<p>The <tt>llvm-test</tt> CVS module contains programs that can be compiled 
with LLVM and executed.  These programs are compiled using the native compiler
and various LLVM backends.  The output from the program compiled with the 
native compiler is assumed correct; the results from the other programs are
compared to the native program output and pass if they match.  </p>

<p>In addition for testing correctness, the <tt>llvm-test</tt> directory also
performs timing tests of various LLVM optimizations.  It also records
compilation times for the compilers and the JIT.  This information can be
used to compare the effectiveness of LLVM's optimizations and code
generation.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/SingleSource</tt>
<p>The SingleSource directory contains test programs that are only a single 
source file in size.  These are usually small benchmark programs or small 
programs that calculate a particular value.  Several such programs are grouped 
together in each directory.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/MultiSource</tt>
<p>The MultiSource directory contains subdirectories which contain entire 
programs with multiple source files.  Large benchmarks and whole applications 
go here.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/External</tt>
<p>The External directory contains Makefiles for building code that is
external to (i.e. not distributed with) LLVM.  The most prominent member
of this directory is the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite.  The presence and
location of these external programs is configured by the llvm-test
<tt>configure</tt> script.</p></li>
      
<li><tt>llvm/test/QMTest</tt>
<p>This directory contains the QMTest information files.  Inside this
directory are QMTest administration files and the Python code that
implements the LLVM test and database classes.</p>

</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="qmstructure">QMTest Structure</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM test suite is partially driven by QMTest and partially
driven by GNU Make.  Specifically, the Features and Regression tests
are all driven by QMTest.  The <tt>llvm-test</tt> module is currently
driven by a set of Makefiles.</p>

<p>The QMTest system needs to have several pieces of information
available; these pieces of configuration information are known
collectively as the "context" in QMTest parlance.  Since the context
for LLVM is relatively large, the master Makefile in llvm/test
sets it for you.</p>

<p>The LLVM database class makes the subdirectories of llvm/test a
QMTest test database.  For each directory that contains tests driven by
QMTest, it knows what type of test the source file is and how to run it.</p>

<p>Hence, the QMTest namespace is essentially what you see in the
Feature and Regression directories, but there is some magic that
the database class performs (as described below).</p>

<p>The QMTest namespace is currently composed of the following tests and test
suites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feature
            <p>
These are the feature tests found in the Feature directory.
They are broken up into the following categories:
            </p>
<ul>
  <li>ad
    <p>Assembler/Disassembler tests.  These tests verify that a piece of LLVM
    assembly language can be assembled into bytecode and then disassembled
    into the original assembly language code.  It does this several times to
    ensure that assembled output can be disassembled and disassembler output
    can be assembled.  It also verifies that the give assembly language file
    can be assembled correctly.</p></li>

  <li>opt
    <p>Optimizer tests.  These tests verify that two of the optimizer passes
    completely optimize a program (i.e.  after a single pass, they cannot
    optimize a program any further).</p></li>

  <li>mc
    <p> Machine code tests.  These tests verify that the LLVM assembly
    language file can be translated into native assembly code.</p></li>

  <li>cc
    <p>C code tests.  These tests verify that the specified LLVM assembly
    code can be converted into C source code using the C backend.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The LLVM database class looks at every file in the Feature directory and
creates a fake test hierarchy containing
<tt>Feature.&lt;testtype&gt;.&lt;testname&gt;</tt>.  So, if you add an LLVM
assembly language file to the Feature directory, it actually creates 5 new
tests: assembler/disassembler, assembler, optimizer, machine code, and C code.
</p>

<li>Regression
  <p>These are the regression tests.  There is one suite for each
  subdirectory of the Regression directory.  If you add a new subdirectory
  there, you will need to modify, at least, the <tt>RegressionMap</tt>
  variable in <tt>QMTest/llvmdb.py</tt> so that QMTest knows how to run the
  tests in the new subdirectory.</p>

</ul>
    
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="progstructure"><tt>llvm-test</tt> 
Structure</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

  <p>As mentioned previously, the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module  provides three 
  types of tests: MultiSource, SingleSource, and External.  Each tree is then 
  subdivided into several categories, including applications, benchmarks, 
  regression tests, code that is strange grammatically, etc.  These 
  organizations should be relatively self explanatory.</p>

  <p>In addition to the regular "whole program"  tests, the <tt>llvm-test</tt>
  module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different ways.  
  If the variable TEST is defined on the gmake command line, the test system will 
  include a Makefile named <tt>TEST.&lt;value of TEST variable&gt;.Makefile</tt>.  
  This Makefile can modify build rules to yield different results.</p>

  <p>For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses <tt>TEST.nightly.Makefile</tt> to
  create the nightly test reports.  To run the nightly tests, run <tt>gmake
  TEST=nightly</tt>.</p>

  <p>There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree.  Some of them are
  designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the LLVM
  research group.  They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to writing your
  own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes that you develop with 
  LLVM.</p>
      
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="run">Running the LLVM Tests</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>First, all tests are executed within the LLVM object directory tree.  They
<i>are not</i> executed inside of the LLVM source tree. This is because the
test suite creates temporary files during execution.</p>

<p>The master Makefile in llvm/test is capable of running only the QMTest driven
tests. By default, it will run all of these tests.</p>

<p>To run only the QMTest driven tests, run <tt>gmake qmtest</tt> at the
command line in llvm/tests.  To run a specific qmtest, suffix the test name with
".t" when running gmake.</p>

<p>For example, to run the Regression.LLC tests, type 
<tt>gmake Regression.LLC.t</tt> in <tt>llvm/tests</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that there are no Makefiles in <tt>llvm/test/Features</tt> and
<tt>llvm/test/Regression</tt>. You must use QMTest from the <tt>llvm/test</tt>
directory to run them.</p>

<p>To run the <tt>llvm-test</tt> suite, you need to use the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>cd into the llvm/projects directory</li>
  <li>check out the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module with:<br/>
  <tt>cvs -d :pserver:anon@llvm.cs.uiuc.edu:/var/cvs/llvm co -PR llvm-test</tt><br> 
  This will get the test suite into <tt>llvm/projects/llvm-test</tt></li>
  <li>configure the test suite. You can do this one of two ways:
  <ol>
    <li>Use the regular llvm configure:<br/>
    <tt>cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure</tt><br/>
    This will ensure that the <tt>projects/llvm-test</tt> directory is also
    properly configured.</li>
    <li>Use the <tt>configure</tt> script found in the <tt>llvm-test</tt> source
    directory:<br/>
    <tt>$BUILD_SRC_DIR/configure --with-llvmsrc=$LLVM_SRC_ROOT --with-llvmobj=$LLVM_OBJ_ROOT</tt>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>gmake</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the second and third steps only need to be done once. After you
have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it again (unless
the test code or configure script changes).</p>

<p>To make a specialized test (use one of the
<tt>llvm-test/TEST.&lt;type&gt;.Makefile</tt>s), just run:<br/>
<tt>gmake TEST=&lt;type&gt; test</tt><br/>For example, you could run the
nightly tester tests using the following commands:</p>

<pre>
 % cd llvm/projects/llvm-test
 % gmake TEST=nightly test
</pre>

<p>Regardless of which test you're running, the results are printed on standard
output and standard error.  You can redirect these results to a file if you
choose.</p>

<p>Some tests are known to fail.  Some are bugs that we have not fixed yet;
others are features that we haven't added yet (or may never add).  In QMTest,
the result for such tests will be XFAIL (eXpected FAILure).  In this way, you
can tell the difference between an expected and unexpected failure.</p>

<p>The tests in <tt>llvm-test</tt> have no such feature as of this time. If 
the test passes, only warnings and other miscellaneous output will be generated.  
If a test fails, a large &lt;program&gt; FAILED message will be displayed.  
This will help you separate benign warnings from actual test failures.</p>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
The <a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/testresults/">LLVM Nightly Testers</a>
automatically check out an LLVM tree, build it, run the "nightly" 
program test (described above), run  all of the feature and regression tests, 
and then delete the checked out tree.  This tester is designed to ensure that 
programs don't break as well as keep track of LLVM's progress over time.</p>

<p>
If you'd like to set up an instance of the nightly tester to run on your 
machine, take a look at the comments at the top of the utils/NightlyTester.pl
file.  We usually run it from a crontab entry that looks ilke this:
</p>

<pre>
5 3 * * *       LLVM_LIB_SEARCH_PATH=.../llvm-gcc/bytecode-libs $HOME/llvm/utils/NightlyTest.pl -parallel -enable-linscan ...CVSREPOSTRING... $HOME/buildtest-X86 $HOME/cvs/testresults-X86
</pre>

<p>Or, you can create a shell script to encapsulate the running of the script.
The optimized x86 Linux nightly test is run from just such a script:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
BASE=/proj/work/llvm/nightlytest
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@llvm.cs.uiuc.edu:/var/cvs/llvm
export BUILDDIR=$BASE/build 
export WEBDIR=$BASE/testresults 
export LLVMGCCDIR=/proj/work/llvm/cfrontend/install
export PATH=/proj/install/bin:$LLVMGCCDIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/proj/install/lib
export LLVM_LIB_SEARCH_PATH=/proj/work/llvm/cfrontend/install/bytecode-libs
cd $BASE
cp /proj/work/llvm/llvm/utils/NightlyTest.pl .
nice ./NightlyTest.pl -nice -release -verbose -parallel -enable-linscan -noexternals
</pre>

<p>
Take a look at the NightlyTest.pl file to see what all of the flags and 
strings do.  If you start running the nightly tests, please let us know and 
we'll link your page to the global tester page.  Thanks!
