NAME
</h3>

analyze

<h3>
SYNOPSIS
</h3>

analyze [options] &lt; filename&gt;
<h3>
DESCRIPTION
</h3>

The analyze command performs various analysis of LLVM bytecode.  It will
usually print the results on standard output, but in a few cases it will print
output to standard error or generate a file with the analysis output (which is
usually done when generating output for another program).
<h3>
OPTIONS
</h3>

<ul>
	<li> -help
	<br>
	Print a summary of command line options.
	<p>

	<li> -stats
	<br>
	Print statistics.
	<p>

	<li> -time-passes
	<br>
	Record the amount of time needed for each pass and print it to standard
	error.
	<p>

	<li> -q
	<br>
	Quiet mode.  With this option, analysis pass names are not printed.
	<p>

	<li> -load &lt;plugin.so&gt;
	<br>
	Load the specified dynamic object with name plugin.so.  This file
	should contain additional analysis passes that register themselves with
	the analyze program after being loaded.
	<p>
	After being loaded, additional command line options are made available
	for running the passes made available by plugin.so.  Use '<tt>analyze
        -load &lt;plugin.so&gt; -help</tt>' to see the new list of available 
	analysis passes.
	<p>
</ul>

<h3>

If analyze succeeds, it will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an error occurs, it
will exit with a non-zero value.
