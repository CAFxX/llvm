	be.c: Replaced "char*" with "const char*" to avoid compiler warnings.

	b.h be.c fe.h gram.y lex.c main.c map.c nontermainl.c plan.c zalloc.c:
	A cursory look through our logs and comments indicates that these are
	the only modified files.  No feature enhancements have been made;
	rather, all changes either fix minor programming errors, get rid of
	warnings, ANSI-ify the code, or integrate Burg into our build system.
