# This directory contains regression tests for the GCC C frontend for LLVM.  
# These tests are C source files that are input to GCC and compiled to .ll
# files. After that, the files are assembled by the LLVM 'as' program to make
# sure GCC emitted something valid.  This is intended to catch crashers and bad
# output by GCC.  Miscompilations by GCC should be caught by the 
# test/Programs/SingleSource/UnitTests test suite
