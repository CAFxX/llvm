# Program: grep-not
#
# Synopsis: Search the input to the program for a regular expression, working
#           just like grep.  The only difference is that we return success if
#           the pattern was not found, and failure if it was.  This is useful
#           for TestRunner tests which want to make sure something DOES NOT
#           occur in the output of a command.
#
# Syntax:   The same as grep

if grep $@
then exit 1
else exit 0
